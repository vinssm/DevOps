				DevOps:

- Requirement analysis
- Design
- Coding
- Build
- QA
- Deploy


		Dev + Ops

	End to End Automation

- Using Continuous integration and Continuous Deployment Pipelines

- Pipelines are stages that performs set of tasks for build and deploy

		
		CI           Jenkins
	Code <------------------------------> Deployable Artifact

- Develops build a software with conyinuous integration pipeines, Deployable artifact is generated and pushed to artifactory, which is universal artifact repository.


- Deveps take the depoyable artifact and deploy with continuous deployment pipelines.


Continuous Integration:

- Developer works n a local dev evnironment, the SCM system is GitHub/Bit Bucket, where source code is stored. 

- Developer commits and pushes code to GitHub where it auto triggers the CI Pipeline, the code is then downloaded from GitHub.

_ It is build using Maven (POM.xml), MS BUild or Gradle etc ... based on technology you use.

- unit tests are run based on the technlogy like JUnit or NUnit etc.. 

- The Binaries are Packaged :

	eg: Jar, War, Ear, Zip, Msi

- And the package is published to artifactory management system which is Jfrog artifactory or Nexus etc...

- Code scan is run using SonarQube pr ADSF scan.

- Optionally there is a trigger to Deploy to dev.

- The CI pipeline invokes the Continuous Deployment Pipeline and the artifact is deployed to the Linux or Windows Target Server. 

Continuous Deployment:

- In this case this is more of DevOps operations, DevOps operations team writes the automation code.

- They can operate in the local Dev Environment or IDE of their choice. 

- They stil have to work with the Source Code Managemnent System, which is GitHub and they store the Automatin code + the Continuous delivery meta files.

- When a DevOps engineer commits and pushes code to GitHub auto triggers Continuous Deployment pipeline, Which is combination of Jenkins and Maven POM.xml for Java projects.

- The Deployment happens through the Ansible Tower.

- The first stp is ready artifact from Jfrog.

- Now you need to move the artifacts from Dev to next environment.

- We have a concept of Gating, where an approver used to approve the movement of Artifact from Dev to Higher Stages. 

- Once the approval is done the artifact is deployed to any LLE (Lower Level Environments) through Ansible, functional tests can be run against the artifact. 

- After LLE the artifact can be moved to production through a gated approval. 



Overall flow for Jenkins:

	- Prebuild
	- Build
 	- Post Build

- Approver once again approves the artifact to move to Production.

- Deployment happens to production using Ansible.

	------- DevOps  --------
- Maximize the time spent colaborating with the business on Ideas.
- Code/Test/Deploy is faster using Agile Methdolagy.
- Code and solution can always be validated and automated.
- Constantly able to build out new business features frequently.
- Features / Code are always "Production ready".
